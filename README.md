# Obsidian Code Files

> Plugin for ObsidianMD to show and edit code files along other notes.

The plugin adds a code editor view to Obsidian. The code editor uses the powerful
[Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), which also powers VS Code.

In the plugin settings, you can configure for which file extensions the editor will be
available as default editor. You can also create new code files, either by right clicking
on a folder in the side pane and clicking on "Create Code File", search for
"Create new Code File" in the command palette or by using the "Create Code File" button
in the ribbon.
